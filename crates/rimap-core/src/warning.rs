//! Shared pipeline warning codes and their severity classification.
//!
//! `WarningCode` is consumed by `rimap-content` (which emits the codes
//! during parsing) and by `rimap-audit` (which records them in
//! `ResultSummary.security_warnings_emitted`). It lives in `rimap-core`
//! so both crates can reference the typed enum without a
//! `rimap-content -> rimap-audit` dependency inversion.
