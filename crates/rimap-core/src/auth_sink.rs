//! Trait seam for emitting [`AuthEvent`] records without coupling
//! the IMAP transport to a specific audit-log implementation.
//!
//! `rimap-imap`'s `Connection` holds an `Arc<dyn AuthEventSink>` and
//! calls [`AuthEventSink::emit_auth`] from within
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` — implementations may perform
//! synchronous filesystem I/O (the `rimap-audit::AuditWriter` impl
//! takes the writer's mutex and writes one JSONL line) and MUST NOT
//! be invoked from an async context without that wrapping.
//!
//! Implementations live downstream:
//! - `rimap-audit::AuditWriter` records to the rotated, locked
//!   on-disk log.
//! - Test fixtures can supply an in-memory `Vec<AuthEvent>` collector
//!   via a small adapter.
