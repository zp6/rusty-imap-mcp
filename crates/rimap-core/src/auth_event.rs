//! Authentication-outcome event shared between the IMAP transport
//! crate (which emits) and the audit writer (which records).
//!
//! Lives in `rimap-core` so `rimap-imap` can build and hand off
//! `AuthEvent` values without taking a dependency on `rimap-audit`.
//! The audit writer keeps the on-disk representation in sync by
//! storing this struct verbatim inside its `auth` payload variant —
//! the field order, names, and serde attributes are the on-disk
//! wire format.
